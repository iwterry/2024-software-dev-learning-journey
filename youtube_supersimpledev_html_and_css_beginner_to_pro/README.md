I worked through [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev)'s HTML and CSS course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc. SuperSimpleDev's GitHub page for the course is at https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/html-css-course-2022.

I focused on the CSS and not so much on using semantic HTML elements.
