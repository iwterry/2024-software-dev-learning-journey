I worked through Mosh Hamedani's JavaScript testing courses at https://codewithmosh.com/p/complete-react-testing-course and https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-javascript-unit-testing.

Mosh's GitHub repos for these courses are at https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/javascript-testing-starter and https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/react-testing-starter.
