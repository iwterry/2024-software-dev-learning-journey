I worked through https://www.udemy.com/course/css-layouts-masterclass/. The images were obtained from the course.

I hope to work through the course occassionally. Here is where I will put what I have done so far in the course.

I may not use as much semantic HTML elements here because I am emphasizing only practicing CSS.
